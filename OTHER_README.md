# ANOTHERTUX, but another plan for it.

AnotherTux is a mod of a SuperTux nightly build in between 0.6.3 and 0.7.0. Jump and run through a world you've seen before, along with some new worlds, with the cost of levels per world.

## The Main Stuff

The art is reverted to 0.6.3.

Some enemies being removed to make this mod smaller, as one of the main things about this mod is it needs to be under 500 MB.

Things are more organized here too because I prefer everything to be organized, although it does take more clicks to get to things.

A lot of songs are removed because some songs are now for cutscenes or for all worlds, like how New Super Mario Bros Wii reused some of it's songs. Night.ogg should be an all-world thingy anyways.

There are 4 main worlds, however, there is a time travel thing planned for the Crystal Cave (World 4) similar to how it seems Sonic 2 would've done it.

Each world has a mininum of 10 levels, however, some worlds may have more.

This mod's levels will be more simple, and they will be similar to New Super Mario Bros Series levels with the simplicity of them.

## WORLDS (PRESENT)

World 1 is Icy Island (II Castle will be based on the ice mechanic and the sliding mechanic and will be named Slippery Fortress) (II Boss is Yeti. He will not have his Pinch Mode and he will just be 3 lives) (This has been finished!)

World 2 is Giant Sewers (GS Castle will be based on entering pipes and swimming) (GS Boss is undecided)

World 3 is Poisonous Desert (PD Castle will be based on rising poison) (PD Boss is undecided but might be a poison monster thingy)

World 4 is Crystal Cave (The final level of it is not a castle, instead, it will have the player collecting crystals and getting a Crystal Of Time to travel to the past) (CC Boss will be Nolok, who after being defeated, would travel to the past, which is why Tux follows him to the past)

## WORLDS (PAST)

World 1 is Snowy Paradise (Icy Island but there's way more snow. There's also more trees and some new enemies. Spikys and Flying Snowballs are absent from the past so they dont appear) (The castle is made out of snow and is still focused around ice) (SP Boss is Yeti, again, however, he has 5 lives and he throws some walking stalactites)

World 2 is Mountain Mines (MM Castle will be based on walljumping and climbable objects) (MM Boss will either be an absolutely GIANT owl or a Grizzly Bear) (Giant Owl would work by sending other Owls to drop skydives and then it'll dive down like a Zeekling to attack Tux. It's pinch mode will be it flying away {which means you have to climb more mountain to get to it} and then it'll do it's diving down thing when Tux gets there) (Grizzly Bear would work by throwing various enemies at Tux while hiding behind a wall, but then that wall would get revealed and it'd only take 1 hit to defeat it, however, there'd be multiple different phases anyways)

World 3 is Burning Desert (Poisonous Desert but with lava instead of poison) (BD Castle will be based on falling lava and would go into the ground, and then it'll be rising lava and it would go back up) (BD Boss will be a cactus thingy)

World 4 is Crystal Cave, but in the past, and only 1 level this time as Tux finds a shortcut) (There would be no boss this time, but Tux would see Nolok time travelling back to the present, so Tux would follow Nolok to the present again)

## WORLDS (PRESENT 2)

World 1 / World 9 / World 5 is Nolok Swamp (NS Boss is Nolok, and he is the final boss. Nolok would be like a combination of the Ghost Tree, with the roots, and the Yeti, with how Nolok would work. Nolok would have 2 phases, both with 5 lives. Phase 1 would be like fighting an entire factory level and phase 2 would be like fighting the Yeti and the Ghost Tree (or more accurately, an invincible, invisible Root Sapling))

There might be another mod sorta based on AnotherTux but it'd be about the various worlds that used to be planned for AnotherTux, so here are those worlds.

## WORLDS (POSSIBLE ANOTHERTUX 2?)

World Idea - Fluffy Clouds

World Idea - Christmas Island (AnotherTux version)

World Idea - Cursed Forest

World Idea - Huge Airship

World Idea - Aquatic Cave

World Idea - Savanna Island

World Idea - Bonus Planet

World Idea - Metal Beach

World Idea - Burned Jungle

## DISCLAIMERS

This mod is not made as a generic "haha i finish supertux", I intentionally avoided adding Mountain Peaks.

I am not claiming this is "better" than the original SuperTux at all. This is quite different from SuperTux and I don't want this mod to be compared to the actual game at all.

NONE OF THE LEVELS FROM THE ORIGINAL SUPERTUX WILL BE IN THIS MOD, THE CURRENT ORIGINAL SUPERTUX LEVELS HERE ARE JUST PLACEHOLDERS.

This mod is not made by anyone who has contributed to SuperTux, and it is also not made by anyone who was / are part of SuperTux Team. This is unofficial. Most assets are from SuperTux, although some may be edited.

You should read LICENSES.txt and credits.stxt

This is licensed under the same license of SuperTux. I legally couldn't change that even if I wanted to. I don't want to change it however, since CC-BY-SA and GPL are my favourite licenses ever.

This mod is free, which means if you paid for this, you got scammed!

The source code will always be available, and it'd always be available even if GPL wasn't one of the licenses. I believe FOSS software is great and at least all free-as-in-price software should have their source code be available, even if the license is just source available instead of FOSS / Open Source

You are allowed to use anything from this mod in your mods, games, animations, whatever. Just give credit where credit's due or whatever the saying is.
