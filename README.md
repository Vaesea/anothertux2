# ANOTHERTUX

AnotherTux is a mod of a SuperTux nightly build in between 0.6.3 and 0.7.0.

## The Main Stuff

The art is reverted to 0.6.3.

Some enemies being removed to make this mod smaller, as one of the main things about this mod is it needs to be under 500 MB.

Things are more organized here too because I prefer everything to be organized, although it does take more clicks to get to things.

All normal SuperTux songs are/will be remade / remixed / replaced.

There are 5 main worlds and there are past versions of 4 of them. 6 main worlds if you count the past version of Giant Sewers which is a whole new world named Mountain Mines (yes the entire mountain was knocked down by nolok to create some sewers)

Each world has a mininum of 3 levels, however, some worlds may have more or less. Basically like Sonic zones.

This mod's levels will be somewhat like Sonic levels but a bit less complicated.

## WORLDS

World 1 is Icy Island. (II Castle will be based on the ice mechanic and the sliding mechanic and will be named Slippery Fortress) (II Boss is Yeti. He will not have his Pinch Mode and he will just be 3 lives)

World 2 is Giant Sewers (GS Castle will be based on entering pipes and swimming) (GS Boss is Frankenpipe / Pipester. Call it either of those names I don't really care)

World 3 is Poisonous Desert (PD Castle will be based on rising poison) (PD Boss is Toxi, a poison monster thingy)

World 4 is Crystal Cave (The final level of it is not a castle, instead, it will have the player collecting crystals and going back in time using the Time Crystal so Tux can chase Nolok in the past since Nolok escapes to the past after being defeated in this world) (CC Boss is Nolok)

## WORLDS (PAST)

World 1 is Snowy Paradise. (Icy Island used to be more snowy, but due to climate change, the snow and the ice started melting away more. Blame Nolok) (SP Castle will be made entirely out of snow and it will be based on the ice mechanic and the sliding mechanic. It will be named Slippery Snowtress) (SP Boss is a snowman that has three snow thingys. You know EXACTLY what I'm talking about)

World 2 is Mountain Mines (The sewers were made out of the stone of the Mountain Mines, and to make the sewers, Nolok had to knock down the entire mountain) (MM Castle will be inside the mountain and it will be based on mechanics that allow Tux to go higher like wall-jumping, as this level will be a tower level!) (MM Boss is either going to be a giant Owl or a big bear)

World 3 is Burning Desert (Nolok messing around turned the lava into poison) (BD Boss will be based on rising AND falling lava) (BD Boss is Lav, he's basically the same as Toxi because he IS Toxi, but now he's made out of lava)

World 4 is yet again Crystal Cave (Tux goes through a different path this time, but there is a boss fight again, and that boss is named Crysty)

## WORLDS (PRESENT, FINALE)

World 5 is Crocodile Swamp. (CS's final level isn't a castle, but it's an entrance to the castle, and it's based on the power of the 3 Power Crystals inside the factory castle thingy) (CS Boss is Nolok, again)

World 6 is Nolok's Castle (NC's Final Boss is Crystal Nolok, which is basically Nolok but he's using one of the Power Crystals... but if you were to find a time crystal that Nolok stole, you would be able to unlock another final boss...)

World 7 is Time Purgatory (TP is 1 level but that 1 level is a boss fight) (TP Boss is Crysty in his Crystal Form, which is basically Crysty with all 4 Power Crystals of Nolok... but if you were to find a fifth power crystal around, you could unlock the TRUE final boss...)

World 8 is Crystal Heaven (CH is 1 level but that 1 level is a boss fight) (CH Boss is Crystal Guardian in both his non-crystal form and his Crystal Form with all 5 Power Crystals that Tux has seen. 1 Power Crystal is able to turn someone into something with the power of Super Sonic, 2 Power Crystals do that but Hyper Sonic's power, 3 Power Crystals turn you into GOD. Now imagine 5 Power Crystals on something that literally is already a god. Yeah the boss fight is meant to be an unfair hell but it gives the true ending)

## DISCLAIMERS

This mod is not made as a generic "haha i finish supertux"

I am not claiming this is "better" than the original SuperTux at all. This is quite different from SuperTux and I don't want this mod to be compared to the actual game at all.

NONE OF THE LEVELS FROM THE ORIGINAL SUPERTUX WILL BE IN THIS MOD

This mod is not made by anyone who has contributed to SuperTux, and it is also not made by anyone who was / are part of SuperTux Team. This is unofficial. Most assets are from SuperTux, although some may be edited.

You should read AUTHORS and credits.stxt

This is licensed under the same licenses of SuperTux because it is a SUPERTUX MOD.

This mod is free, which means if you paid for this, you got scammed.

You are allowed to use anything from this mod in your mods, games, animations, whatever. Just give credit where credit's due or whatever the saying is. I didn't make everything you see in the mod.
