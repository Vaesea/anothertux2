# ANOTHERTUX

AnotherTux is a mod of a SuperTux nightly build in between 0.6.3 and 0.7.0.

## The Main Stuff

The art is reverted to 0.6.3.

Some enemies being removed to make this mod smaller, as one of the main things about this mod is it needs to be under 500 MB.

Things are more organized here too because I prefer everything to be organized, although it does take more clicks to get to things.

All normal SuperTux songs are/will be remade / remixed / replaced.

There are 5 main worlds and there are past versions of 4 of them. 6 main worlds if you count the past version of Giant Sewers which is a whole new world named Mountain Mines (yes the entire mountain was knocked down by nolok to create some sewers)

Each world has a mininum of 3 levels, however, some worlds may have more or less. Basically like Sonic zones.

This mod's levels will be somewhat like Sonic levels but a bit less complicated.

## WORLDS

World 1 is Icy Island. (II Castle will be based on the ice mechanic and the sliding mechanic and will be named Slippery Fortress) (II Boss is Yeti. He will not have his Pinch Mode and he will just be 3 lives) (This has been finished!)

World 2 is Giant Sewers (GS Castle will be based on entering pipes and swimming) (GS Boss is undecided)

World 3 is Poisonous Desert (PD Castle will be based on rising poison) (PD Boss is undecided but might be a poison monster thingy)

World 4 is Crystal Cave (The final level of it is not a castle, instead, it will have the player collecting crystals and getting the Super Flower, which allows Tux to shoot blue fire that can literally just kill anything (not including bosses), however, getting hit while being "Super Tux" will turn Tux into Small Tux)

## WORLDS (PAST)

World 1 is Snowy Paradise. (SP Castle will be made entirely out of snow and it will be based on the ice mechanic and the sliding mechanic. It will be named Slippery Snowtress) (SP Boss is Yeti, again. This time he has 5 lives and a pinch mode)

## DISCLAIMERS

This mod is not made as a generic "haha i finish supertux"

I am not claiming this is "better" than the original SuperTux at all. This is quite different from SuperTux and I don't want this mod to be compared to the actual game at all.

NONE OF THE LEVELS FROM THE ORIGINAL SUPERTUX WILL BE IN THIS MOD, THE CURRENT ORIGINAL SUPERTUX LEVELS HERE ARE JUST PLACEHOLDERS.

This mod is not made by anyone who has contributed to SuperTux, and it is also not made by anyone who was / are part of SuperTux Team. This is unofficial. Most assets are from SuperTux, although some may be edited.

You should read LICENSES.txt and credits.stxt

This is licensed under the same licenses of SuperTux.

This mod is free, which means if you paid for this, you got scammed.

You are allowed to use anything from this mod in your mods, games, animations, whatever. Just give credit where credit's due or whatever the saying is.
