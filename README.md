# ANOTHERTUX

AnotherTux is a mod of a SuperTux nightly build in between 0.6.3 and 0.7.0. Jump and run through a world you've seen before, along with some new worlds, with the cost of levels per world.

## The Main Stuff

The art is reverted to 0.6.3.

Some enemies being removed to make this mod smaller, as one of the main things about this mod is it needs to be under 500 MB.

Things are more organized here too because I prefer everything to be organized, although it does take more clicks to get to things.

A lot of songs are removed because some songs are now for cutscenes or for all worlds, like how New Super Mario Bros Wii reused some of it's songs. Night.ogg should be an all-world thingy anyways.

There are 10 main worlds, which means there are roughly 100 main levels planned. May seem like too much, but normal SuperTux seems to have been more quanitity-over-quality before 0.7.0.

There is also going to be a World 11 which is like this mod's version of World 9, yet again another NSMB series reference, excluding the DS version of NSMB.

Each world has a mininum of 10 levels, however, some worlds may have more.

This mod's levels will be more simple, and they will be similar to New Super Mario Bros Series levels with the simplicity of them.

## WORLDS

World 1 is Icy Island. (II Castle will be based on the ice mechanic and the sliding mechanic and will be named Slippery Fortress) (II Boss is Yeti. He will not have his Pinch Mode and he will just be 3 lives) (This has been finished!)

World 2 is Giant Sewers (GS Castle will be based on entering pipes and swimming) (GS Boss is undecided)

World 3 is Poisonous Desert (PD Castle will be based on rising poison) (PD Boss is undecided but might be a poison monster thingy)

World 4 is Crystal Cave (The final level of it is not a castle, instead, it will have the player collecting crystals and getting the Super Flower, which allows Tux to shoot blue fire that can literally just kill anything (not including bosses), however, getting hit while being "Super Tux" will turn Tux into Small Tux)

World 5 is Mountain Mines (MM Castle will be based on walljumping and climbable objects) (MM Boss will either be an absolutely GIANT owl or a Grizzly Bear) (Giant Owl would work by sending other Owls to drop skydives and then it'll dive down like a Zeekling to attack Tux. It's pinch mode will be it flying away {which means you have to climb more mountain to get to it} and then it'll do it's diving down thing when Tux gets there) (Grizzly Bear would work by throwing various enemies at Tux while hiding behind a wall, but then that wall would get revealed and it'd only take 1 hit to defeat it, however, there'd be multiple different phases anyways)

World 6 is Fluffy Clouds (FC Castle will be based on the Flip Potion and gravity) (FC Boss will be a Robot Nolok who acts exactly like the Ghost Tree)

World 7 is The Cursed Forest (It'll look like Halloween Island without grass, just rocks, dirt and trees. Also, no water, just poison and lava) (CF Castle will be a mansion and it will be based on 2 new mechanics, the Reveal Block and the Hide Block) (CF boss will be a giant pumpkin named Pumpking and to defeat him, you'd need to make him mold / rot faster)

World 8 is Savanna Island (Temporary name)

World 9 is Aquatic Cave (Way more water-based than Tropical Paradise, but since Tux's underwater controls are way better than most games, it'll actually be some FUN underwater levels... Although there might be some little puzzles and maze levels) (AC Boss is Fisheater. It eats Fish and is a Fish, but also eats literally every living being ever) (The way to defeat it would be to just swim away from it, which makes the boss fight just an autoscroller level, however, when you touch the fish, it's INSTANT death, no losing power-ups, just death)

World 10 is Crocodile Swamp (Nolok is a crocodile, I think) (CS Boss is Nolok, and it is the final boss. Nolok would be like a combination of the Ghost Tree, with the roots, and the Yeti, with how Nolok would work. Nolok would have 2 phases, both with 5 lives. Phase 1 would be like fighting an entire factory level and phase 2 would be like fighting the Yeti and the Ghost Tree (or more accurately, an invincible, invisible Root Sapling))

World 11 is Bonus Planet (BP boss is Ghost Nolok, being a reskin of Nolok to make him look like he's from the Ghost Forest. The fight would be a harder Nolok fight) (Clearly NSMB2)

## DISCLAIMERS

This mod is not made as a generic "haha i finish supertux", I intentionally avoided adding Mountain Peaks.

I am not claiming this is "better" than the original SuperTux at all. This is quite different from SuperTux and I don't want this mod to be compared to the actual game at all.

NONE OF THE LEVELS FROM THE ORIGINAL SUPERTUX WILL BE IN THIS MOD, THE CURRENT ORIGINAL SUPERTUX LEVELS HERE ARE JUST PLACEHOLDERS.

This mod is not made by anyone who has contributed to SuperTux, and it is also not made by anyone who was / are part of SuperTux Team. This is unofficial. Most assets are from SuperTux, although some may be edited.

You should read LICENSES.txt and credits.stxt

This is licensed under the same license of SuperTux. I legally couldn't change that even if I wanted to. I don't want to change it however, since CC-BY-SA and GPL are my favourite licenses ever.

This mod is free, which means if you paid for this, you got scammed!

The source code will always be available, and it'd always be available even if GPL wasn't one of the licenses. I believe FOSS software is great and at least all free-as-in-price software should have their source code be available, even if the license is just source available instead of FOSS / Open Source

You are allowed to use anything from this mod in your mods, games, animations, whatever. Just give credit where credit's due or whatever the saying is.
